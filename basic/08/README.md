## Method : 01

#### 01. Define a function that accepts one input called `n`.
#### 02. Initialize two variables: `num1 = 0 and num2 = 1` to store the first two Fibonacci numbers.
#### Display a message saying “Fibonacci Series up to `n` terms:”.
#### Use a for loop that runs from `1` to `n`.
#### During each iteration, print the current value of `num1`.
#### Calculate the next number by adding `num1` and `num2`, and store it in a variable called `next`.
#### Update `num1` with the value of `num2`, and `num2` with the value of `next`.
#### After the loop ends, the complete Fibonacci series will be displayed as the output.
